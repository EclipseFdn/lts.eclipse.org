Eclipse is well known for being an open source community that embraces commercial adoption. As adopters come to depend on products built on Eclipse technology, the ability to maintain these products through their complete life cycle becomes an important factor.

Maintenance is a major part of the life cycle of a software project. Therefore, Eclipse LTS enables long term maintenance for Eclipse technologies to help adopters to stay on top of regular software updates to avoid problems upfront, as well as to react to problems that impede users.

## The Problem

You are using Eclipse technology as an underlying platform for your business critical applications.

You or your customer are using the solution for years. Then your system breaks due to a bug in the underlying Eclipse components, due to a new feature, an operating system upgrade or some other reason.

Now what? Eclipse code is open source. You can either fix the code yourself (which isn't really easy), rely on the community or ask others for help and support. This is where the Long Term Support Initiative comes into the picture.

## The Solution

Eclipse users, contributors, and the Eclipse Foundation are working together to create an eco-system for Long-Term Support of the Eclipse code.

Within this eco-system, you will find companies or individuals that will service you. Choose a service provider that is best for you in the Â [LTS Marketplace](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/category/markets/long-term-support) and the [list of organizations](/about/infrastructure) providing the [LTS infrastructure](/about/infrastructure).

The advantage over doing it yourself or working outside of the LTS eco-system is that your service provider is a subject matter expert and has access to existing issues. The expert will provide you with reliable new builds, aggregated and tested on a Eclipse Long-Term Support infrastructure.
