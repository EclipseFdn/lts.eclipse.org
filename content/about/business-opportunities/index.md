The Eclipse LTS eco-system provides a variety of business opportunities for companies or individuals with Eclipse expertise.

Subject matter experts will be contracted to work on solutions for issues or enhancements in older versions of Eclipse projects.

Large organisations such as system integrators can offer service level agreements (SLA) to fully support their client, based on the fact, that LTS infrastructure and the subject matter experts are working reliably.

The [Eclipse LTS Marketplace](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/category/markets/long-term-support) is the portal where the customers and the maintenance providers will meet.

The [Eclipse LTS Infrastructure providers](/about/infrastructure) support a collaborative, reliable and cost-effective platform to manage, integrate, test and distribute the solution to the issues that have been found. In particular, it is the place where all the fixes from the various parties can be collected and made available to all eligible parties.
