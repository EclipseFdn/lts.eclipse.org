The Eclipse LTS Industry Working Group enables an ecosystem of service providers, technology providers and large enterprise consumers of Eclipse to share fixes and releases.Â  It also provides the IT infrastructure to fix, build, sign and deploy updates for older versions of Eclipse. The LTS infrastructure includes code repositories, bug tracking, knowledge management, and software distribution & code signing.
