Long Term Support provides the infrastructure and ecosystem for the support of Eclipse in industries that require Eclipse releases to be maintained over a very long time. Industries such as aerospace, automotive, and enterprise software are expected to support their software stack for 10-50 years. Often, community-based support is not enough to meet customer expectations. The Eclipse LTS initiative allows these companies to release bug fixes and maintenance releases of previous versions of Eclipse technologies.
