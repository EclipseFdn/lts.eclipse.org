The LTS initiative is open to any organization with an interest in long-term support and maintenance for Eclipse technology.Â  Members of the LTS working group must also be members of the Eclipse Foundation.

There are four membership levels: Guest, Participant, Premium, and, Steering Committee.

*   **Guest members** are organizations who have been invited by the Steering Committee of LTS WG for a 6 month Guest Membership. . Typical guests are potential future full-fledged members who want to have a closer look before deciding on their strategy. Guest members are required to sign a participation agreement and they do not have voting rights in LTS WG meetings. Guest members will have the same access rights as Premium members for the duration of their membership. At the end of the 6 month trial period their access rights will be terminated.

*   **Participant members** have access to the download site providing LTS binaries.

*   **Premium members** have Participant level access as well as access to the LTS forge and build farm.

*   **Steering Committee members** have Premium level access and also governance influence over the direction of the IWG such as budget and resource allocation
